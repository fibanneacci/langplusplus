## ‚úîÔ∏è Purpose

Most widely-used programming languages are English-based, making the learning process difficult for many non-English speakers intending to use these languages in their studies and/or careers. lang++ addresses this issue using the translation functionality shown above.

## ü•Ö Goals

 * Expand language-programming language translation database
    * As of now, lang++ supports 4 lang-prog lang combinations (Chinese, Spanish, and Japanese to C++, Chinese to Java, and Chinese to Swift)
 * Incorporate machine learning / natural language processing
    * Improve translation accuracy
    * Consider context when suggesting autocompletes.
    * Better account for evolution/change of programming languages overtime.
 * Potential to be expanded into plugins, extensions, etc.
    * Will better serve people looking for occasional language help
    * Could function similar to dictionary

See [issues](https://github.com/fibanneacci/langplusplus/issues) for detailed tasks and descriptions.
